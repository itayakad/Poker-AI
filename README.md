# Poker-AI

**pokerbot.py** implements a heads-up poker game in Python, where a human player competes against an AI poker bot. The game manages player actions such as betting, folding, checking, calling, and raising, with betting rounds occurring after dealing community cards (flop, turn, river). The AI player has realistic logic for different scenarios. The script tracks the chips, pot, and alternates the dealer between rounds. The game continues until one player runs out of chips or the player decides to stop. The winner is determined by comparing the best hands after the final betting round.
